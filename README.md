# Sparta-Project-1

## Description
### For my gaming project, I made the classic  Nokia Snake game. The aim of the game is to control the snake using the keyboard arrow keys to move the snake around the playground. Random food will appear on the playground for the snake to eat and grow in size. You have to avoid collision with the walls around the playground and avoid eating your body.
